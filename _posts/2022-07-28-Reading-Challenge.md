## Libraries are great

Public libraries are even better. They're one of the few indoor places you dont have to pay to hang around in. They give anyone and everyone access to a quiet place to study or work, computers and of course an extensive collection of books. And for what? The cost of a room and some (many) sheets of paper.

Like a lot of people, I *used to* read a lot as a kid but lost the habit over the years. A few months ago I started to use the library just across the road from my college to finish up the year's projects. While I was there, I picked up a new library card and took out a book. It was much easier than I expected to get back into it!

My routine is to reserve books online and drop down to my local library when they arrive. It takes about 2 minutes to grab the book off the shelf and check it out using the self service machines. Super handy.

## The Challenge

The main downside to this process is often having to wait for a book to become available and then get delivered. Which is why I reserved 12 at once and now have 5 thick novels checked out at the same time. (You can reserve books for future dates to avoid this)

So partially for fun and partially because I have to return them at some point, I'm gonna try to **finish them all in 10 days (28th July -> 6th August)**. I'll keep updating my status at the top as I go and make a new post when time is up.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have some reading to do.
