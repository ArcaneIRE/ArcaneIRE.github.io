 description: Short reviews of 5 books from my 10-day reading challenge.

Recently I challenged myself to read 5 novels in 10 days. I've finished them now, although it ended up taking 17 days! I liked that I had an extra reason to pick up a book; it was satisfying to mark my progress and see the bars fill in. Another win for [SMART](https://asana.com/resources/smart-goals) goal setting.

I'm not just looking to pat myself on the back for reading a handful of books. I thought I'd leave some short **spoiler-free** reviews since, with them fresh in my head, I think I'm in a good position to compare and contrast. In the past couple of months I've started books in 3 famous fantasy universes/series so if you're interested in exploring the genre this might give you a good place to start!

### 5. REAMDE

Essentially a nerdy action movie in book form. It hits all the notes you'd hope for, given that definition, and has a great attention to detail without being cringy with the techy stuff. However, it relies heavily on the (admittedly good) execution of action scenes while lacking a cohesive feeling story arc or strong emotional payoff. On top of that, it was the longest book of the 5 at over 1000 pages which makes it a hard one to recommend.  
**5.5/10**

### 4. Warbreaker

Having read a few other books from *the Cosmere*, I found I was a little dissapointed. It felt like a 'typical' Sanderson experience in a sort of cosy, unchallenging kind of way. Some trope subversion, proactive characters unearthing a slow drip of plot hints and a gradual exploration of the magic system culminating in a big chaotic ending. Still, a decent book overall and as a relatively short, standalone novel I think it would be a good introduction to Sanderon's works.  
**6/10**

### 3. Gardens of the Moon

*Gardens of the Moon*  does an impressive job of involving and developing a wide cast of characters, cultures and locations. It has a large scope, without sacrificing detail, and while giving the impression that you're only seeing a slice of the overall world. I found it to be heavily plot focused and sometimes a bit of a slog, but with many cool elements in play, I was always interested. I would recommend it for people who enjoy plot driven stories and thorough worldbuilding.  
**7/10**

### 2. The Hero of Ages  

The finale of the first Mistborn trilogy, *The Hero of Ages* was a satisfying ending to the series. Sanderson is very creative with the hard rules of his magic system here, in a way that makes revelations feel earned and gives the reader the chance to figure things out on their own. Let down a little by the nebulous primary antagonist, I would still heartily recommend the mistborn trilogy if you like the idea of competent, realistic characters standing up against impossible odds.
**7.5/10**

### 1. The Eye of the World

My clear personal favourite. An obviously Tolkien inspired journey, *The Eye of the World* has expert pacing, strong characters and an absorbing setting. It was a refreshing change from the more strict, relentless *Gardens of the Moon* and *Hero of Ages*. It endears you to its protagonists in a way reminiscient of*The Fellowship of the Ring* but with a more grounded, human approach. A classic-feeling epic fantasy story that I can't wait to explore more of.  
**9/10**
