 description: Some thoughts and personal reflection on failure.

*Revised 04/09/23*
Of course, I’ve heard people say “don’t be afraid to fail” since I was a child, but thats not the same as taking it to heart. Nowadays, I spend far more time thinking about what I could do, than actually doing those things. Trying to find the "best" programming language, ideal framework and project to finally pour some effort into. Half researching, half waiting for it to fall in my lap. This has led to to me not really having any depth in my programming knowledge, or a half decent project to my name.

Funny as it sounds, I only started looking seriously at the process of improvement when I tried to become a better League of Legends player. Through league coaches, I gained a better understanding of *why* the fear of failure is bad.

Learning happens when you push yourself, not from doing the same comfortable habits on repeat (*have I ever told you the definition of insanity*). When you're resistant to push yourself and try new things, you are avoiding learning opportunities and increasing the stress of those inevitable failures. A trendy example is how SpaceX blew up rocket after rocket until they iterated and learned their way to the top of the rocket building business. Imagine if they were afraid of bad press after a rocket explosion, and only launched when they were 99.9% sure it would work? They would have lost out on valuable experimental data, and lowered their iteration time. That's what happens to you when fear, or pride, inhibits your actions.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1230636014001061891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Failure is not the enemy, in fact it's a mandatory part of both learning and life. The real failure is failing to try at all.

I was afraid of making a mediocre project because I didn’t want people to look at my work and see novice mistakes. *That* is failure. With that attitude, I haven’t given myself the chance to make those novice mistakes, then fix and learn from them. And so I remain a novice.

This post is an open letter to remind myself and others that failure is not something to hide from. The theme I’m running on this site isn’t exactly what I wanted, but it’s *good enough* and the site is *actually running*. The message I want to tell myself is: Make a crappy to-do list app, blow up some rockets, learn from your mistakes and become *better*.
